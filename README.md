#### Vault
***
The user's funds are stored in a dedicated on-chain vault, which will not be mixed with others. For their own vault, the user has the highest authority, and even the project party cannot misappropriate the funds.

```onlyOwner```
```solidity
    function withdrawErc721NFT(uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        uniInfo.nonfungiblePositionManager.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
        positionMap.deleteDeposit(tokenId);
    }

    function withdrawTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function withdrawETH(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

#### Token Allowlist
***
All tokens that can be swapped and have liquidity added require permission from the user's allowlist to execute, effectively preventing hacker attacks and the bulk purchasing of shitcoins.

```solidity
    /*
        Vault Allowlist Token Mapping
    */
    struct AllowTokenObj {
        address tokenAddress;
        address aTokenAddress;
        bool allowed;
    }

    struct TokenAllowedInfo {
        AllowTokenObj[] allowList;
        mapping(address => AllowTokenObj) tokenExists;
    }

    modifier allowListCheck(address tokenAddress) {
        require(tokenAllowedInfo.tokenExists[tokenAddress].allowed, "NA");
        _;
    }

```
